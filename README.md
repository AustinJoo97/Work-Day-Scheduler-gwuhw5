# Workday Planner

This application will serve as a simple and user-friendly daily planner that breaks up a day's events into hourly blocks from 9am to 6pm. Each block will have a color noting if the time has passed, is within the current hour, or has yet to come. Additionally, they can be edited to add or remove events and, upon clicking a timeslot's corresponding save button, will save these events (only the events connected to the clicked save button) as to not lose them if the application were to reset/reload. Finally, if all activities for the day have been comepleted or must be removed for any other reason, there is a "clear schedule" button at the bottom of the page to do just that; it will both wipe all saved events from memory as well as automatically refresh the page for the user to start anew.
